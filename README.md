# LOG8430E-Review-Assignment
Review Assignment repository  - LOG8430E Fall 22 - Team Zulu


# To run the code
1. Deploy a T2 large instance on AWS - OS Ubuntu 20.04 (but 22.04 should work as well)
2. Clone this git repository on the instance
3. In the same folder were the git repository is cloned, install YCSB version 0.17.0 (If you do "ls", there should be ycsb-0.17.0 and LOG8430E-Review-Assignment folders)
4. Do cd LOG8430E-Review-Assignment folders
5. Make sure that the experiment.sh file has the right permissions (chmod +x experiment.sh)
6. run sudo ./experiment.sh
7. Your run results should appear in the LOG8430E-Review-Assignment folder (we manually organized our results in the Results folder)
